"# personal_repo" 

Hello! Thanks for your curiosity.

My name is Ebuka Peter Asie

I am a masters student, currently studying MSc Data Science and Analytics with Placement year.

This Repo is for my learning journey in this lovely field of playing with data and solving problems.

I hope to learn as much as possible to help provide solutions.

I am documenting all the pet projects I have done, either in paid learning environment or during self learning.

I am open to help and collaborations.

About Me: I love thinking, that's what I know how to do best. 

I have a good attitude towards work and I am very ambitious.

I adapt easily to new environment, be it learning or otherwise. 

I studied Mathematics in my undergraduate degree.

I have working knowledge of Advanced Excel, SQL and PowerBI.

Presently equipping myself with Python knowledge for Data Science and RStudio for statistical analysis.

I love to explore problems. I sometimes get lazy with easy stuffs, but hard stuffs keep me on my toes and I love it.

Behind all these is a friendly introverted guy [largely introverted i will say].

Thanks for reading. I will keep updating my README as I garner new knowledge.
